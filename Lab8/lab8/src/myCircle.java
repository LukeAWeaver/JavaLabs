    //Make a method that calculates the diameter of a circle. Recall the radius is half of the diameter.
    //This method will take no parameters and return a double.
    //Why no parameters? Because the circle class has a radius built in. All methods in the Circle class have access to it without it being passed
    //as a parameter! Sweet!




    //Make a method that returns the area of a Circle.
    //This method takes no parameters.  It returns a double.
    //Recall the area of a circle is PI * radius * radius
    //Since our circle has PI and radius as properties, we can use those in our function without passing them in as parameters. Tubular!

    

    //Make a method that returns the circumference of a Circle.
    //This method takes no parameters.  It returns a double.
    //Recall the circumference of a circle is 2 * PI * radius
    //Since our circle has PI and radius as properties, we can use those in our function without passing them in as parameters. Radical!
